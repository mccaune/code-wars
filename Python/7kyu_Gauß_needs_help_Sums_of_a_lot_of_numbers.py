"""
Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young GauÃŸ, Herr J.G. BÃ¼ttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.

Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

Here's, an example:

f(n=100) // returns 5050 

It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#).

    sum = 0
